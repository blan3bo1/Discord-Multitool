A powerful multi‑tool for macOS that lets you run multiple Discord instances simultaneously with different accounts, and optionally auto‑complete quests on them.  
Inspired by the minimalist dark aesthetic of [blankboii.xyz](https://blankboii.xyz).

## ✨ Features

- **Multiple Discord Instances** – Launch 2, 3, or more Discord windows side‑by‑side, each with its own account.
- **Account Manager** – Store and manage multiple Discord tokens with names and notes.
- **Auto‑Login** – Automatically inject tokens into new instances so you don’t have to log in manually.
- **Quest Helper** – Automatically detect and complete active Discord quests on running instances (video, play, stream, activity).
- **Dark Minimalist GUI** – Clean, black‑based interface with snowflake decorations and status indicators (inspired by blankboii.xyz).
- **Window Visibility Fixes** – Ensures windows actually appear on screen using multiple activation techniques.
- **Conflict Prevention** – Intelligently kills only unmanaged Discord processes, keeping your own instances and their children alive.
- **Isolated Data Directories** – Each account gets its own user data folder, preventing session conflicts.
- **Live Resource Monitoring** – See CPU and memory usage for each running instance.
- **Import/Export Accounts** – Easily backup or transfer your account list.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- **macOS 11.0+** (Big Sur or newer) – Intel or Apple Silicon.
- **Discord Desktop App** installed (Stable, PTB, or Canary).
- **Python 3.9+** (3.10 or 3.11 recommended).
- **Homebrew** (optional, for easy Python installation).

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/blan3bo1/Discord-Quest-Completer.git
cd Discord-Quest-Completer
```

### 2. Set up a virtual environment
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` is not present, install the essential packages manually:
```bash
pip install psutil requests websocket-client pytz
```

### 4. Configure your Discord path
Edit `config.json` (it will be created automatically on first run) to match your Discord version:

```json
{
    "discord_path": "/Applications/Discord.app",
    "discord_executable": "Discord",          // "Discord PTB" or "Discord Canary" if needed
    "max_instances": 3,
    "instance_delay": 5,
    "debug_port_start": 9222,
    "injection_delay": 15,
    "auto_login": true,
    "auto_start_quests": false,
    "log_level": "INFO"
}
```

### 5. Add your accounts
Run the GUI and go to **Accounts** → **Add**, or manually edit `accounts.json` (a template will be created the first time you run the tool).

**Getting your Discord token:**
- Open Discord in your **browser** (not the app).
- Press `F12` to open Developer Tools.
- Go to the **Console** tab.
- Type: `localStorage.getItem('token')` and press Enter.
- Copy the output (remove the surrounding quotes).

### 6. Launch the GUI
```bash
python gui.py
```

---

## 🖥️ GUI Overview

The interface is split into three tabs:

### 📋 Accounts Tab
- List of all your accounts with their status (running/stopped), PID, port, CPU/memory usage.
- Buttons to launch selected accounts, launch all enabled, stop all, refresh, and manage accounts.
- **Selection is persistent** – even with auto‑refresh, your chosen accounts stay selected.
- Double‑click an account to edit its details.

### 🎮 Quest Helper Tab
- Run the quest‑completion script on selected accounts or on all running instances.
- Progress and errors are shown in the log area.

### ⚙️ Settings Tab
- Configure Discord path, executable name, instance limits, delays, and auto‑login.
- Changes are saved to `config.json`.

The footer displays the current time in PDT (matching blankboii.xyz), along with the "I'm Too Tired / dnd / Sleeping ngl is" status line.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

| Problem                          | Possible Solution |
|----------------------------------|-------------------|
| `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pytz'` | Install it: `pip install pytz` |
| Discord executable not found     | Check `discord_path` and `discord_executable` in `config.json`. Run `ls -la "/Applications/Discord.app/Contents/MacOS/"` to see actual executable names. |
| Second instance window doesn’t appear | Make sure you have granted Terminal/Accessibility permissions in **System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility**. |
| Instances keep getting killed     | Our conflict killer now preserves child processes. If you still see killings, run `killall Discord` manually, then restart the launcher. |
| Auto‑login fails                  | Ensure the debug port is reachable: `curl http://localhost:9222/json/list`. Increase `injection_delay` in config. |
| Quest helper doesn’t complete quests | Discord may have updated its internal modules. The quest script may need an update. Check the console for errors. |
| `_tkinter.TclError: cannot use geometry manager grid inside ... pack` | This has been fixed in the latest GUI. If you still encounter it, ensure you are using the provided `gui.py` without modifications. |
